Human Eye Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning
Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict and classify human eye diseases using retinal images. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis of various eye conditions, potentially aiding medical professionals in providing timely interventions.
Features

Automated Disease Classification: Predicts multiple eye diseases from retinal images.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a custom CNN architecture or transfer learning with pre-trained models.
High Accuracy: Trained and validated on diverse datasets to ensure robust performance.
User-Friendly Interface: (Optional) Includes scripts for easy model inference and visualization.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Virtual environment (recommended)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/milind55555/Human-Eye-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Human-Eye-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:

tensorflow>=2.10.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0



Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of retinal images, such as the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset or a custom dataset. Key details:

Classes: Multiple eye diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract).
Format: Images in PNG/JPEG format with corresponding labels.
Preprocessing: Images are resized to a uniform resolution (e.g., 224x224) and normalized.

To use your own dataset:

Place images in the data/ directory.
Ensure labels are provided in a CSV file (e.g., labels.csv) with columns for image paths and disease labels.

Model Architecture
The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16) fine-tuned for eye disease classification. Key components:

Input Layer: Accepts preprocessed retinal images.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features like edges and patterns.
Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important features.
Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.
Output Layer: Provides probabilities for each disease class.

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized with Adam.
Usage

Prepare the Dataset:Ensure your dataset is organized in the data/ directory or update the dataset path in the configuration file.

Train the Model:Run the training script:
python train.py --data_dir data/ --epochs 50 --batch_size 32


--data_dir: Path to the dataset.
--epochs: Number of training epochs.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.


Evaluate the Model:Test the trained model on a validation set:
python evaluate.py --model_path models/model.h5 --test_data data/test/


Inference:Use the trained model to predict diseases on new images:
python predict.py --model_path models/model.h5 --image_path path/to/image.jpg


Visualize Results:Generate visualizations of model predictions:
python visualize.py --model_path models/model.h5 --image_path path/to/image.jpg



Results
The model achieves competitive performance on the test set:

Accuracy: ~XX% (update with actual results after training)
Precision/Recall/F1-Score: Detailed metrics available in results/metrics.csv after evaluation.

Sample predictions and visualizations can be found in the results/ directory.
