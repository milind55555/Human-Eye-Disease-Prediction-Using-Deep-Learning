# Human-Eye-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
Overview
This project implements deep learning-based eye disease prediction using MobileNetV3-Large, a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is optimized for mobile and edge devices, making it efficient for real-time medical diagnosis.

The system can classify diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and normal eyes using retinal images. It aims to assist ophthalmologists by providing automated and accurate disease detection.

Why MobileNetV3-Large?
MobileNetV3 is a highly optimized CNN architecture designed for low-latency and high-accuracy applications, making it ideal for medical imaging tasks.

Lightweight: Faster inference on mobile and embedded devices.

Efficient: Uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational cost.

High Accuracy: Optimized with SE blocks (Squeeze-and-Excitation) and hard-swish activation for improved feature learning.

Better Performance: Outperforms older models like VGG16 in terms of speed while maintaining competitive accuracy.
